Create data for the testimonial section of the landing page with a single title for the testimonial section, as well as at least 4 sample testimonials . The data should be in pain json, with no additional formatting. Only produce the title and testimonials, nothing else.

below is a sample of how the data should be returned:

{
        "title": "What Our Users Say",
        "testimonials": [
            {
                "author": "John Doe",
                "company": "Acme Corporation",
                "content": "This landing page builder has been a game-changer for our team. We've seen a significant increase in conversions since switching to it."
            },
            {
                "author": "Jane Smith",
                "company": "Tech Solutions Inc.",
                "content": "The ease of use and customization options are incredible. I can create professional-looking landing pages in minutes."
            },
            {
                "author": "Peter Jones",
                "company": "StartupXYZ",
                "content": "The pre-built templates saved me so much time. I was able to launch my landing page within hours of getting started."
            },
            {
                "author": "Sarah Lee",
                "company": "Creative Agency",
                "content": "I love the integration with Next.js. It's smooth and efficient, allowing me to build landing pages that perfectly align with my existing website."
            }
        ]
    }

the format of the response should math the sample exactly, don't add any extra formatting for json.
